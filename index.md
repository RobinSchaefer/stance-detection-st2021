## Welcome to Stance Detection (Summer Term 2021)

This is the accompanying page for the course "Stance Detection", which I teach at the University of Potsdam in the Summer Term 2021 as part of the Bachelor of Science program "Computerlinguistik". The course is taught in German.  

The course combines theoretical viewpoints on stance with practical approaches to stance detection. This page is used for the latter. I plan to add experimental code relying on Jupyter Notebooks. 

More information will be given in the course.

### 1. Prerequisites

This course relies on a couple of tools that shall help us while we investigate stance detection. As I do not assume you to be experts, here are a couple of tutorials to get you started. We will talk about the tools in the course as well. (If you are already set up feel free to skip this section.)

#### 1.1. Python

All code examples presented/discussed in this course are written in Python. As the module of the course is scheduled for the third or fourth semester, which happen to be same semesters where programming is taught, I do not require you to know how to code already (although some familiarity will help of course). This in no introduction to Python programming. In order to enable everyone to participate I will provide Jupyter Notebooks which you can manipulate. 

If not happened already, please install Python (Version: >=3.6.). Find out how to do this by having a look on the [Python homepage](https://www.python.org/).
