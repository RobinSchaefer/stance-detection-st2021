## Welcome to Stance Detection (Summer Term 2021)

This is the accompanying page for the course "Stance Detection", which I teach at the University of Potsdam in the Summer Term 2021 as part of the Bachelor of Science program "Computerlinguistik". The course is taught in German.  

The course combines theoretical viewpoints on stance with practical approaches to stance detection. This page is used for the latter. I plan to add experimental code probably relying on Jupyter Notebooks. 

More information will be given in the course.
